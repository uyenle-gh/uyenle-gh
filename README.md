### Hi, this is Uyen Le ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Computer Science at Denison University :woman_technologist:. 

It was during my studies at Denison that I developed an interest in programming and discovered my passion for Data Science and Enterprise Architecture. I am dedicated to using my skills to tackle complex problems and create impactful solutions :cupid:.
